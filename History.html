          <p style="color:black;">Queen Elizabeth II has loved corgis since she was a little girl. The young Elizabeth and her sister, princess Margaret, were invited to play with the children of Viscount Weymouth, who had a young corgi at home. </p>
          <p style="color:black;">The girls became infatuated, and soon begged their parents, The Duke and Dutchess of York for one. Which is how Dookie, a chestnut corgi puppy provided by Rozavel kennel in Pirbright, Surrey, came into the family in 1933. By the time the parents became King George IV and Queen Elizabeth in 1937, the young princesses had several corgis to play with. </p>
          <p style="color:black;">For her eighteenth birthday in 1944, the King gave Princess Elizabeth a two-month-old Pembroke Corgi puppy with the registered name Hickathrift Pippa; she was called Sue, which became Susan. Susan was the first of a long line of Corgis and Dorgis (Dachshund/Corgi crosses) owned by the Queen, all of them descended from Susan.</p>
          <p style="color:black;">Princess Elizabeth did not want to be separated from Susan, so following her wedding to Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, at Westminster Abbey in 1947, Susan was hidden under rugs as the Princess and the Duke of Edinburgh travelled through London in an open carriage on the way to their honeymoon. In early 1959, Susan caused a stir when she bit a policeman who was patrolling Buckingham Palace. It was the fourth time she had bitten someone at the palace. On the previous occasions it had been a sentry, a detective, and the royal clock winder.</p>

          <p style="color:black;">By her first mating, with Lucky Strike of the Rozavel kennel, Susan was the mother of Sugar (officially Prince Charles' dog) and Honey, who became the Queen Mother's favourite. She was later bred with a Rozavel dog named Rebellion; the Queen kept two puppies from that litter.</p>
